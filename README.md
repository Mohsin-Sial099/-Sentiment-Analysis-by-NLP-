# Sentiment Analysis by NLP

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`sentiment-analysis-by-nlp.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention.

## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool in the field of NLP that allows us to extract subjective information from text data. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform sentiment analysis using Python and popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, and VADER.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK
- TextBlob
- VADER Sentiment Analysis
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk textblob vaderSentiment pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-by-nlp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-by-nlp
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook sentiment-analysis-by-nlp.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform sentiment analysis on your text data.

## Methodology
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing text data.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data (tokenization, stopwords removal, etc.).
3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
   - Using TextBlob for polarity and subjectivity analysis.
   - Using VADER for sentiment scoring.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the sentiment analysis results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of different sentiment analysis techniques.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations and insights into the sentiment analysis results, including:
- Sentiment distribution across the dataset.
- Comparison of different sentiment analysis tools.
- Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments.
